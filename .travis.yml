# Deploy to GitHub pages on commits to master
#
#  1. Clone current gh-pages branch into dist/
#  2. Copy in new README
#  3. Push dist/ directory to gh-pages branch
#
# Cloning the existing gh-pages branch ensures that we don't lose the
# CNAME, _config.yaml, and any other files generated by gh-pages when
# pushing the new README.
