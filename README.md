# Awesome Common Lisp [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) [![Assertible status](https://assertible.com/apis/102e334d-f9a8-4565-9353-7572de775cae/status?api_token=8b55a286830323effb)](https://assertible.com/docs/guide/deployments)

A curated list of _awesome_ Common Lisp libraries.

For awesome *software*, see [lisp-lang.org's success stories](http://lisp-lang.org/success/) and the [awesome-cl-software](https://github.com/azzamsa/awesome-cl-software) list.

All libraries listed here are available from [Quicklisp][16] unless
stated otherwise. The ones marked with a ‚≠ê are so widespread and
solid that they became community standards. You can't be wrong with
them. This is the case for Quicklisp, BordeauxThreads and
such. Libraries denoted with a üëç are the ones we like and want to
promote here at the Awesome-cl list. They proved solid, they may solve
a problem better than a community standard but they aren't as
widespread, or not considered as stable. For example, we prefer
Spinneret over Cl-Who.

Add something new! See the [contributing](#contributing) section for adding something to the
list.

Other scripting utilities
-------------------------

* [WCL](https://github.com/wadehennessey/wcl) [stalled] - allow hundreds of Lisp
applications to be realistically available at once, while allowing
several of them to run concurrently.  WCL accomplishes this by
providing Common Lisp as a Unix shared library that can be linked with
Lisp and C code to produce efficient applications.  For example, the
executable for a Lisp version of the canonical `Hello World!`
program requires only 20k bytes on 32 bit x86 Linux.  WCL also
supports a full development environment, including dynamic file
loading and debugging.  A modified version of GDB is used to debug WCL
programs, providing support for mixed language debugging.

Contributing
============
Your contributions are always welcome! Please submit a pull request or create
an issue to add a new framework, library or software to the list.

The rules we (try to) respect are the followings:

- by default, add a library to the end of its section.
- absolute de-facto libraries, like BordeauxThreads or Quicklisp,
  should be denoted with a ‚≠ê (Unicode code U+2B50).
- two libraries very similar in scope should be side by side, or in a
  section of their own.
- do some curation based on your experience and the state of the
  library's documentation. We do *not* aim at listing every existing
  CL library (see Cliki for that) nor to list every
  "popular" library (see Quicklisp stats).
- as such, the libraries we like best are marked with a üëç (`1F44D`
  unicode character). See also the signs' explanation in the
  introduction.
